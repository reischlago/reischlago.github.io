					<h2>Hello, I'm Ágoston</h2>
					<p>An IT professional with several years of work experience in different development, support and

								I started working at Webhelp in January of 2023, where I joined a team which solely
								works for Google, providing technical support for the most premium clients of Google. My
								area of expertise is networking, so I mainly work with IT professionals to resolve their
								issues on the Google Cloud Platform, which are related to theirloud or hybrid
								network.<br>
								After 5 months of being in the job, there was an internalopportunity to qualify as a
								Subject Matter Expert, so I can offer guidance and technical expertise not just in my
								local colleagues, but for others around the globe as well.<br>
								In this job, I have gained valuable experiences in managing stressful customers and
								resolving technical issues quickly and efficiently, as we are handling highly reputable
								customers. When something is not working as expected the time we spend on resolving or
								mitigating the issues can be measured in millions of dollars, which also affects the
								customers' anxiety level.<br>
								As part of the networking team, my main field of work is regarding Kubernetes, Load
								Balancing, hybrid connectivity, network performance, Cloud DNS, and other networking
								products.

								After being promoted from a trainee position, I became responsible for the maintenance,
								development and management of the IT Infrastructure of the ING Bank Hungary Branch,
								which consistsof a main office, two data-centers and a DR location.<br>
								In this position I had the chance to manage or take part in various projects, such as
								the office relocation aftercare, network redesign, LCM projects, office Audio-Visual
								solution implementation, physical security system implementation, etc. My role required
								me to be in constant contact with vendors, support teams and, of course, local
								departments.<br>
								In this position I worked closely together with the IT SecurityOfficer and the
								Application Operations team, regarding the network component of any required reports. It
								also required me to implement security measures for vulnerabilities found in in-house or
								externally audited penetration tests.
							</div>
							<div class="text2">
								As an IT Infrastructure Trainee, I had a significant role in the last phases of an
								office relocation and renovation project. During the renovation I have represented the
								IT requirements regarding physical network cabling, for example. I supported projects
								such asthe implementation of audio-visual devices and physical security systems. During
								my job I was the point of contact for the IT Infrastructure team with my colleagues,
								with vendors and with our network support staff mainly from Poland and the Netherlands.
								Due to the pandemic I was the remote hand as well for our network support team, thus I
								gained experiences in the physical implementation of networks.
