					<h2>Hello, I'm Ágoston</h2>
					<p>An IT professional with several years of work experience in different development, support and
						management positions; skilled in various fields, from web-design at a small company, through IT
						Infrastructure management in the Hungarian branch of ING Bank, to  working as a Cloud
						Engineer for Google, providing premium support on the Google Cloud Platform for Networking
						products.</p>
					<p>As a one year hiatus of my professional career, I had succesfully finished my Master's degree 
						at the Unviversity of Amsterdam. The Information Systems track of the Information Studies MSc 
						is focusing on translating societal, economical and practical needs into information technology 
						requirements. Developing prototypes for research based solutions was an integral part of the studies, 
						which were developed through teamwork full of experiments. <br>
						The Master's Thesis titled "Anomaly detection in smart buildings: A case study of the University of 
						Amsterdam's Lab42 building" was about the development of a pipeline prototype, for detecting anomalies 
						in a building of the University of Amsterdam, using machine learning methods over the vast amount of 
						sensor data.

								I started working at Webhelp in January of 2023, where I joined a team which solely
								works for Google, providing technical support for the most premium clients of Google. My
								area of expertise is networking, so I mainly work with IT professionals to resolve their
								issues on the Google Cloud Platform, which are related to theirloud or hybrid
								network.<br>
								After 5 months of being in the job, there was an internalopportunity to qualify as a
								Subject Matter Expert, so I can offer guidance and technical expertise not just in my
								local colleagues, but for others around the globe as well.<br>
								In this job, I have gained valuable experiences in managing stressful customers and
								resolving technical issues quickly and efficiently, as we are handling highly reputable
								customers. When something is not working as expected the time we spend on resolving or
								mitigating the issues can be measured in millions of dollars, which also affects the
								customers' anxiety level.<br>
								As part of the networking team, my main field of work is regarding Kubernetes, Load
								Balancing, hybrid connectivity, network performance, Cloud DNS, and other networking
								products.

								After being promoted from a trainee position, I became responsible for the maintenance,
								development and management of the IT Infrastructure of the ING Bank Hungary Branch,
								which consistsof a main office, two data-centers and a DR location.<br>
								In this position I had the chance to manage or take part in various projects, such as
								the office relocation aftercare, network redesign, LCM projects, office Audio-Visual
								solution implementation, physical security system implementation, etc. My role required
								me to be in constant contact with vendors, support teams and, of course, local
								departments.<br>
								In this position I worked closely together with the IT SecurityOfficer and the
								Application Operations team, regarding the network component of any required reports. It
								also required me to implement security measures for vulnerabilities found in in-house or
								externally audited penetration tests.
							</div>
							<div class="text2">
								As an IT Infrastructure Trainee, I had a significant role in the last phases of an
								office relocation and renovation project. During the renovation I have represented the
								IT requirements regarding physical network cabling, for example. I supported projects
								such asthe implementation of audio-visual devices and physical security systems. During
								my job I was the point of contact for the IT Infrastructure team with my colleagues,
								with vendors and with our network support staff mainly from Poland and the Netherlands.
								Due to the pandemic I was the remote hand as well for our network support team, thus I
								gained experiences in the physical implementation of networks.

								Information Studies is a broad and interdisciplinary field, primarily concerned with analysing, collecting, classifying, 
								manipulating, storing, retrieving and disseminating information. It examines how people, organisations and any existing 
								information systems interact, in order to create, replace, improve or understand those systems. <br>
								In the Information Studies' track Information Systems I learned to conceptualise, build and evaluate complex technical 
								systems in a techno-social context. Through applied and research-based education and experimentation I became an expert 
								in emerging and future technology in information systems. I have encountered themes like sensor technology, semantic web 
								technology, mobile systems, information retrieval and privacy.<br>

								My master's thesis </a> examined the possibilities of using vast amount of sensor data for anomaly detection in a smart university building.
								As part of the thesis project, a prototype pipeline was developed that started with the collection of data, and through the 
								macine learning based anomaly detection, ended with the visualisation of the results. The prototype was developed in Python, 
								using Pandas, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib.
